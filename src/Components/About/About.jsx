          I graduated from the University of Southern California with a
          Bachelor's degree in Real Estate Development, where I developed a
          solid foundation in finance, project management, and market analysis.
          Over the years, I gained valuable experience working in real estate
          finance, collaborating on complex deals, and understanding the
          intricacies of the industry. However, during this time, I discovered
          my true passion for technology and problem-solving.

          After working in real estate, I realized that my growing interest in technology was
          something I couldn’t ignore. I was drawn to the analytical challenges
          of programming and the potential to create innovative solutions that
          could impact various industries, including real estate. This
          realization led me to pursue a career shift into software development,
          where I could apply my problem-solving mindset to building impactful
          applications.

          I took a deep dive into coding through a software
          development bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience in web development
          with JavaScript, React, and Python. I’ve become particularly
          passionate about using technology to streamline processes and build
          user-centered applications.
